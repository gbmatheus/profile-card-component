## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/)

### What I learned

The use of the BEM methodology, which consists of Block - Element - Modified. Block is the component itself. Element is the smallest element that makes up the block. It is a modifier which is used to change the appearance or behavior of the block. This methodology proves to be very useful for organizing projects and reusing components.


```html
<!-- Block -->
<section class="content">
  <!-- Block__Element -->
  <p class="content__description">
  <!-- Block__Element-Modifier -->
  <p class="content__description-highlight">
</section>
```
### Continued development

Maybe by CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Documentation BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - This helped me a little with the functioning of the BEM methodology.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-position/) - This is an amazing article that finally helps me understand how the **background-position** property, which I used to position the background images, works.
